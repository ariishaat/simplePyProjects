### Quick Overview

Random solutions I created for a few number problems suggested in this [repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects) using Python.

-----------------

### Files in this project:

* fib-sequence.py:

In function `getFibSeq()` user enters a number, the fibonnaci sequence up to that number is returned

* floor-cost.py:
User enters a width, height, and cost per square foot to cover a rectangular floorplan, function `tileCalc()` outputs the total cost.

* PI-to-Nthdigit.py:

User enters integer n in `findPi()`, displays Pi up to n number of decimal places
  
* prime-factor.py:

`primeForUser()` takes a number (user input) and displays a list of prime numbers up to that number, the user can continue to input numbers or enter stop to end the program.
